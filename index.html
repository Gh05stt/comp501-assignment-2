        <p id="introduction">
          Imagine, a fully autonomous vehicle is travelling on the motorway. On its left, a motorcyclist with no helmet,
          and on the right, a motorcyclist in full safety gear. Suddenly, a large box falls off the truck in front of
          the
          car. Should the car swerve into the protected, or the unprotected motorcyclist? Should it punish the
          individual
          doing the right thing, or almost certainly kill someone else? This thought experiment is similar to the one
          Jason Millar (2014) poses with his Tunnel Problem. But it raises an interesting ethical dilemma, when an
          autonomous vehicle must make a life or death decision, who decides what the car does, the Drivers, Legislators
          or Manufacturers, and who bears the responsibility. If a human was driving the car, their response in this
          situation would simply be a reaction, it is near impossible for a human to accurately analyse and act on the
          information in this scenario. However, for an autonomous car with hundreds of sensors and cameras, the
          response
          is a decision, closely resembling first degree murder (International Assoc of Chiefs of Police, 1977). This
          paper explores the ethical problems surrounding autonomous vehicles and how society can address these dilemmas
          responsibly
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p id="safer-vehicles">
          The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) conducted an investigation which found that over 94% of
          crashes within the United States of America (USA) alone were due to Driver error (U.S. Department of
          Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2018).
        </p>
        <img src="images/crash-reasons.png" alt="">
        <p>
          Whether it's distracted driving, speeding or impaired driving. These are all issues that can be remedied by a
          fully autonomous vehicle, making driving a safer mode of transport. A 2024 study found that only 1.8% of
          accidents involving an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) were due to distractions or poor driving behaviour,
          compared to 19.8% for human-driven vehicles (HDV). Furthermore, in accidents where a HDV hit an ADV, 82%
          resulted in a minor injury compared to when an ADV hit an HDV, where injuries dropped to 67% (Abdel-Aty &
          Ding, 2024). However, it is important to note that the ADVs had a higher risk of crashing at dusk, dawn and
          during turning manoeuvres than HDVs. Although this is likely to decrease as the underlying machine learning
          algorithms improve.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="document">
        <p>
          These findings suggest that ADVs are overall safer, but they're not immune to crashing.
          Which raises a key question, who should be liable in the event of a crash? Current laws assume a human driver
          is responsible, but this approach is inadequate as the vehicle itself is responsible for making all of the
          decisions. Gurney (2013) argues that liability could fall on the manufacturer or developer, as the car's
          decision making is determined by a programmed algorithm. Whereas others suggest a shared liability model,
          where responsibility is distributed amongst stakeholders such as the owner, manufacturer and occupants of the
          vehicle depending on the circumstances of the accident (Shavell, 2020). From a deontological perspective,
          placing liability to manufacturers aligns with the principle of duty, as manufacturers have an obligation to
          ensure their products cause no harm. However, under a utilitarian perspective, a shared liability approach may
          not produce the greatest good.
          <br><br>
          If companies are solely liable for ADV accidents, progress in autonomous driving could stall due to excessive
          risk and hesitation from shareholders. However, if no party is liable, then victims may never receive justice
          or closure, undermining public trust in the technology, halting the adoption of such vehicles. Ultimately, it
          is regulators who will decide who is at fault, facing the ethical challenge of balancing responsibility,
          innovation, and public safety when regulating autonomous vehicles.
        </p>
        <p id="environmental-impact">
          Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly improve traffic efficiency, making driving a faster
          and more sustainable form of transport. With less vehicles idling in congestion, fuel waste decreases, leading
          to lower greenhouse gas emissions and an overall reduced environmental impact. A recent study found that
          through Vehicle to Vehicle communication, carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 25% and fuel consumption
          by 18% (Jayawardana & Wu, 2022). Notably, even with only 25% adoption of connected autonomous vehicles, 50% of
          the results can be attained. This presents a major opportunity for society to mitigate the environmental
          impacts from transportation as climate change continues to threaten global sustainability. However, current
          autonomous vehicles are expensive, and many opt to purchase a cheaper, non-autonomous vehicle once learning
          the cost of an autonomous vehicle (Chase et al., 2018).
          <br><br>
          While there is no definitive figure on how much cheaper autonomous vehicles will be, forecasts indicate
          significant cost declines as the technology matures. One study estimates the operating cost for ADVs per mile
          could fall from $0.35USD to $0.15USD by 2040 (Goldman Sachs, 2025). This trend suggests that it is highly
          likely that adoption will increase as prices decrease, presenting a unique approach to tackling global warming
          emissions from vehicles.
          <br><br>
          Autonomous vehicles rely on various sensors and cameras to work safely and effectively. The underlying machine
          learning algorithms are also trained on this type of data. Which raises concerns about data collection and
          privacy, misuse of this data would violate individual privacy rights. One study found that over 50% of users
          of Uber's self-driving fleet would opt out of data collection, even if they have to spend 5 minutes accessing
          an online system to opt out (Bloom et al., 2017).
      </div>

      <div class="document">
        <p>However, data collection is crucial to improve machine
          learning algorithms, such as those which drive autonomous vehicles. Without sufficient training, an autonomous
          car won't be as safe or efficient, and might even be more dangerous. Humans don't drive according to the road
          code, so for an accurate autonomous vehicle, real-life data is crucial (Aljehane, 2024). Despite this, in the
          event of a security breach, no amount of financial compensation may repair the harm caused.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="morals">
          It is also important to note that the vehicle's so-called 'moral agent' is its underlying programming. From a
          utilitarian perspective, autonomous vehicles should aim to minimise harm which, in our trolley problem, might
          choose to swerve into the protected biker as they are more likely to survive the impact. A deontological
          approach argues that autonomous vehicles should adhere to moral duties, such as never intentionally harming an
          innocent person regardless of the outcome, which would result in the vehicle not punishing the protected
          motorcyclist. It is vital that manufacturers of autonomous vehicles take these ethical principles into account
          when developing new vehicles as autonomous vehicles are not merely new vehicles, they fundamentally reshape
          responsibility and public trust. If the programming is unfair or biased, adoption of autonomous cars could
          stall and even potentially decline.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p id="conclusion">
          Overall, autonomous vehicles stand to significantly benefit society by alleviating traffic, reducing
          greenhouse gas emissions and increasing accessibility for individuals who are unable to drive independently.
          Beyond improving convenience and efficiency, the technology offers the possibility of creating cleaner, safer
          and more inclusive transport systems that can fundamentally reshape the way society moves forward and
          interacts with technology. However, as the technology continues to evolve, it introduces a variety of complex
          legal, ethical and technical challenges that must be addressed. Regulators must take a proactive approach and
          critically evaluate the risks associated, from algorithmic biases and data privacy to accountability and
          decision transparency. Establishing a robust governance framework will be essential to ensure that these
          systems are developed responsibly, without risking public safety.
          <br><br>
          Ultimately, achieving an ethical balance between innovation, regulation and safety will determine the success
          of autonomous vehicles. Transparent oversight and continuous ethical reflection will be crucial in growing
          public trust and ensuring that the development of autonomous vehicles aligns with the broader interests of
          humanity.
